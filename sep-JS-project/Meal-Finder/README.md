# Meal-Finder

using fatures of HTML CSS & JS
basic implementations

So in this application I have built a meal finder that works with the meal D.B. API.
So basically one can search for a meal or search for keyword, And if one click the Search button here it's going to reach out to the API and return any meals that have keyword in it.
